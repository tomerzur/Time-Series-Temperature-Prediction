# Time-Series-Temperature-Prediction
In this project I will be predicting the daily max temperatures in four different Australian cities (Melbourne, Cairns, Perth, and Alice Springs). I picked these four cities because they are located far away from each other geographically, and have different weather patterns and climates.

The data source I am using is a csv of the weather data from a bunch of different Australian cities. This dataset is publicly available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).
